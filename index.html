        <h2>Aspiring Computer Science/Business Professional</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Keerthana and I am a high school student with a strong passion for Computer Science, Biology, and Business. I look forward to combining my passions by going into the field of Computational Biology and creating my own business to support larger causes.
          
          <br>
          <br>
          In my free time, I am also an avid Bharatanatyam dancer and Taekwondo martial artist. I also enjoy reading and spending time with my family and friends. Currently, I am reading Emma by Jane Austen.</p>
